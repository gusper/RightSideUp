I'm pretty sure this is not the final version but it's the only drop of code I could find for it nowadays.

A .NET 2.0 application that automatically rotates images in a folder using EXIF data stored in the image by some cameras.  There's no longer a need to go through each image and manually rotate them yourself. If your digital camera has support for storing an image's orientation (such as the Canon Powershot S500 which has the "Intelligent Orientation Sensor") then you should be able to use RightSideUp to automatically rotate all your images to their correct orientation. The source code is also available for download below and should provide a decent starting point for using and manipulating EXIF data with C# and .NET. 

Latest version: 1.2 (Released December 29, 2005)
